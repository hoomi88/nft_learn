### What I learned


Importing fonts from google:
```css
  @import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Outfit&display=swap");

  body {
    background-color: hsl(217, 54%, 11%);
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;   
  }
```

Configure the horizontal line color (set border to none!!!):
```css
 hr {  
  background-color: hsl(215, 32%, 27%);
  height: 1px;
  border: none;
}
```
